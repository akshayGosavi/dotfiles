# `tre` is a shorthand for `tree` with hidden files and color enabled, ignoring
# the `.git` directory, listing directories first. The output gets piped into
# `less` with options to preserve color and line numbers, unless the output is
# small enough for one screen.

# Change directory and print contents of it
# with (A) . and .. files, force (C)olumn output and show (F) type symbols for directories, symbolic links etc
